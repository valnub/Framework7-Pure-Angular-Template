# Framework7-Pure-Angular-Template
A clean and simple template for Framework7 based on AngularJS with pure HTML5, CSS3 and JS

I had created another template before (https://github.com/valnub/Framework7-Typescript-Template) but for some people this seemed to be to complicated, so I stripped off Grunt, NPM, SASS and TypeScript. The result is a pure template which only consists of html, css and javascript. No compile process, no dependecies and no typescript. Very simple. Just download, copy to localhost and open index.html.
