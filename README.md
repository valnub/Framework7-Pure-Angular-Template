## Framework7-Pure-Angular-Template

### Compatibility
- Framework7 v1 - yes
- Angular 1.x - yes
- Framework7 v2 - no
- Angular 2+ - no

A clean and simple template for Framework7 based on AngularJS with pure HTML5, CSS3 and JS

I had created another template before (https://github.com/valnub/Framework7-Typescript-Template) but for some people this seemed to be to complicated, so I stripped off Grunt, NPM, SASS and TypeScript. The result is a pure template which only consists of html, css and javascript. No compile process, no dependecies and no typescript. Very simple. Just download, copy to localhost and open index.html.

### How to use
